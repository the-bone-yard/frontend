# The Bone Yard -- Frontend

## Project Description 

This application is a dog park locator that allows users to search for dog parks near them or to search by city and state. Users can view details about a particular dog park, get driving directions to a specific dog park, and save dog parks they are interested in. This is a full stack application with the front-end housed on this repository. The repository for the back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/the-bone-yard/backend-repo). This project is the capstone project completed during the final module of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design. 

The BoneYard deployed application can be found [HERE.](https://the-bone-yard-fe.herokuapp.com/#/)

## Future Iterations
While we are very pleased with the results of our efforts so far, we are just as excited about the improvements that are still to come for The BoneYard. From a frontend perspective, we would like to: 

- Enable better user authentication 
- Allow pet owners to create profile(s) for their dog(s)
- Allow dogs to "friend" one another 
- Send messages between users to schedule puppy play dates at a dog park
- Remove park from saved parks
- More and improved error handling (including routes)
- Sort results by rating and/or distance from current location
